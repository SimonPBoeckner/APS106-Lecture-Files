    "## OO Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming with objects as the cognitive model of a problem is called “object oriented programming” (OOP). ('cognitive model' just means the way you think about things) Different from what we have been doing up to now, OOP focuses on the creation of objects which contain both **data and functionality** together and achieving the overall program functionality through the interaction of these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**OOP is a (different) way of thinking about the design and organization of your code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP was developed as a way to handle the size and complexity of software systems and to make it easier to employ teams of programmers to create and maintain these large and complex systems over time. Think about a avionics system for an airplace or an financial accounting system for a bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, each object corresponds to some object or concept in the real world, and the functions that operate on that object correspond to the ways real-world objects interact. For example, we could think of an oven object. The oven allows us to perform a few specific operations, like put an item in the oven, or set the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming, the objects are considered to be active agents. In our early introduction to turtles, we used an object-oriented style, so that we said `tina.forward(100)`, which asks the turtle to move itself forward by the given number of steps. This change in perspective may not be initially obvious, nor might it be obvious that it is useful. But sometimes shifting responsibility from the functions onto the objects makes it possible to write more versatile functions and makes it easier to maintain and reuse code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important advantage of the object-oriented style is that it fits our mental chunking and real-life experience more accurately. In real life a `cook` method is part of our microwave oven — we don’t have a cook function sitting in the corner of the kitchen, into which we pass the microwave! Similarly, we use the cellphone’s own methods to send a text message or switch it to do not disturb. The functionality of real-world objects tends to be tightly bound up inside the objects themselves. OOP allows us to accurately mirror this when we organize our programs.\n",
    "Creating a program as a collection of objects can lead to a more understandable, manageable, and properly executing program.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<big><b>Pro-tip</b></big>\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you get confused about OO, objects, instances, classes, methods, ..., think about Turtles. Turtle is a class. When you create a turtle variable (e.g. tina) you are creating an instance (also called an object) of the class Turtle. When you tell tina to do something, you are calling a method of the Turtle class.\n",
