    "\n",
    "If the two operands of `//` (the two numbers being divided) are both `int`, then the result will be an `int`. If either of the two operands is a `float`, then the result will be a `float` (even though it will have a whole number value).\n",

    "Python has a nice exponentiation operator `**`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modulo\n",

    "The last operator may be new to you. It is the modulo operator repesented by `%`. It is also a kind of division but it results in the **remainder** after dividing the operands. "
