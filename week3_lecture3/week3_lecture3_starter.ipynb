    "The Engineering Design Process is a systematic, iterative approach used by engineers to solve problems and develop solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='section1a'></a>\n",
    "## Steps in the Engineering Design Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learn to Define the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cake.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before solving any problem, it's important to clearly understand what needs to be done. Imagine you're trying to bake a cake‚Äîyou wouldn't just throw random ingredients together without knowing what kind of cake you want, right? Similarly, in programming, defining the problem means figuring out what the program should do, what inputs it will need, and what the expected outcome should be. This helps avoid confusion and ensures you're working towards the right goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practice Defining Test Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/mobile.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the problem is clear, the next step is to think about how you'll check if your solution works correctly. Think of it like testing a new phone‚Äîbefore buying, you'd probably check if the camera works, the battery lasts long enough, and if it fits your needs. In programming, test cases are like these checks; they help confirm whether the program behaves as expected for different inputs, including both normal and unexpected ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Develop an Algorithm Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/travel.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"400\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into writing code, it‚Äôs smart to create a plan, just like making a travel itinerary before going on a trip. You wouldn't just pack your bags and leave without knowing where you're going and how you'll get there. Similarly, an algorithm plan outlines the steps the program should follow to solve the problem efficiently. This makes it easier to stay on track and avoid unnecessary detours while coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Your Solution and Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/furniture.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a clear plan, it's time to start coding‚Äîlike building a piece of furniture following an instruction manual. But sometimes things don't fit quite right, and you need to figure out what's wrong. In coding, this process is called debugging. It involves finding and fixing mistakes in the code to make sure everything works smoothly. Testing often and making small changes help in getting to a perfect solution step by step."
